# Lander
This is an implementation of the famous game Lander. The project uses the [Pixel Game Engine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine) and one of its extensions to do the graphical side of things.

# Running the project locally
In order to generate project files for Visual Studio you can run `premake5 vs2019`. It is not advisable to generate project files for other IDEs apart from Visual Studio, since Pixel Game Engine does not work there out of the box.
